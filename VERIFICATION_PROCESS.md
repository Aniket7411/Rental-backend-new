## 🎯 What I'll Check

When you share the frontend team's responses, I will:

1. **Verify Integration Points**
   - Check if they're using backend's `advanceAmount`
   - Verify payment flow integration
   - Confirm error handling

2. **Identify Issues**
   - Find any mismatches between frontend and backend
   - Spot potential bugs
   - Highlight missing implementations

3. **Provide Recommendations**
   - Suggest fixes for any issues
   - Recommend best practices
   - Provide code examples if needed

4. **Create Action Items**
   - List what needs to be fixed
   - Prioritize critical issues
   - Create a fix plan
